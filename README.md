# SVG Spritemap Webpack Plugin Test

Install the package
```
npm install
```

Build the project
```
npm run build
```

Serve the project
```
npm run serve
```

Styles are in base.scss which is the only thing imported in index.js and html markup is in index.html. The plugin outputs generated scss to ./svg/generated and the generated spritemap to the root.
